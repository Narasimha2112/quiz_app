ðŸŽ¯ **Project : MCQ Quiz Web App (Python Flask + ChatGPT)**

I'm excited to share that Iâ€™ve built a **Multiple Choice Quiz Web Application** using **Python, Flask, and Bootstrap 4.5** â€” with complete assistance from **ChatGPT as my AI programming partner**! ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¡

ðŸ”¨ **Technologies Used**

* **Backend**: Python + Flask
* **Frontend**: HTML5, Bootstrap 4.5 (via CDN), CSS
* **APIs**: [Open Trivia Database (OpenTDB)](https://opentdb.com)
* **Tools**: ChatGPT for code generation, debugging, and architectural guidance
* **Features**: No custom JavaScript (except optional timer), clean form-based communication

ðŸ“Œ **Project Highlights**

* The user can choose a quiz **category** from a dropdown (e.g., General Knowledge, Tech).
* On `/quiz`, 5 random MCQs are fetched dynamically using the **Open Trivia API**.
* Each question has **4 options rendered as checkboxes** with unique IDs.
* A **countdown timer** (2 mins) auto-submits the quiz if time runs out.
* On submission, answers are validated **server-side only** using form-data.
* The result page shows a **score breakdown**, with color-coded feedback for correct/incorrect answers â€” all handled using **pure Python and Jinja**.

ðŸ§  **How ChatGPT Helped**
I broke down the project into smaller milestones and collaborated with ChatGPT for each:

* Setting up Flask routes and virtual environment
* Designing templates and passing data
* Integrating Open Trivia API
* Debugging backend logic and form handling
* Styling with Bootstrap
* Implementing advanced features like animated question loading and result evaluation logic

ðŸš€ This project not only improved my full-stack Python skills but also taught me **how to use AI as a productive development assistant**.
